We'd like to do a website for the dentist. Our website will consists of two levels. The first level of the website is probagation of the dentist and his ambulance. The second level would allow the interaction between the dentist and his clients. It means that each client could login to the website using his own password. After logging, the patient will be able to see free and occupied dentists terms and choose on of the free terms. This would save dentists time when ordering patients. Patients should also be able to see his/her history (visits of the dentist,performed surgery, etc.)
